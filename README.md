# llm-skills

A collection of general-purpose LLM skills that I use in my day-to-day development workflow. Each skill is a structured prompt that helps automate common engineering tasks like writing specifications and classifying work items. The prompts can be adapted for use with any LLM-powered coding tool.

## Skills

<!-- SKILLS-INDEX:START -->
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [spec](skills/spec/SKILL.md) | Write solution-agnostic specifications from raw input and classify them as a Story, Task, Spike, Bug, or Epic — rendered in the correct standardised format for sharing with the team. |
| [slack-message](skills/slack-message/SKILL.md) | Craft and send beautifully formatted Slack messages using the Slack MCP. Covers technical Q&A replies and PR notifications, with markdown structure, emojis as visual signposts, and guidance on including ticket links and finding recipients. |
| [workflow](skills/workflow/SKILL.md) | Orchestrate the full software delivery lifecycle — from logging an issue through refinement, implementation, and review. Determines the current step, drives work forward autonomously, and pauses only at human approval gates. |
| [my-issues](skills/my-issues/SKILL.md) | Fetch and display a quick summary of all your active issues across every board and project. Shows a flat table with project, parent, issue ID, title, status, reporter, and labels — sorted by status urgency so the most actionable work appears first. |

## Installation

Each skill is a self-contained markdown prompt in `skills/`. You can use them directly with any LLM by copying the prompt content, or install them as a plugin for supported tools.
